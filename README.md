## Building

### Pre-requisites

A working install of the Idris2 compiler >= v0.7.0 is required. The easiest way
to get this set up is to install Idris2 via
[pack](https://github.com/stefan-hoeck/idris2-pack).

### Compiling

With a working `idris2` in your `$PATH`, the files can be compiled by running

```
idris2 --build tyde24.ipkg
```

### REPL

An interactive REPL session can be started by running

```
idris2 --repl tyde24.ipkg
```

This will load the `Generic` module by default. The other modules can be loaded
by running the REPL command

```
:module ModuleName
```

(replacing `ModuleName` with the name of the module to additionally load.)

After a module has been loaded, its contents can be browsed via the REPL command

```
:browse ModuleName
```
